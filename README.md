## Branch Protection Rules

This repository has specific rules in place to ensure a clean and organized codebase. The following **branch protection rules** are applied to the `main` branch:

### 1. **Restrict Deletions**  
Direct deletion of the `main` branch is not allowed. Any attempts to delete the `main` branch will be blocked.

### 2. **Pull Requests Are Required**  
All changes to the `main` branch must go through a pull request. The rules for pull requests are as follows:
- **Required Approvals**: Every pull request must receive at least **one approval** from a repository collaborator before merging.
- **Dismiss Stale Approvals**: If a new commit is added to the pull request, any prior approvals will be dismissed to ensure the changes are re-reviewed with the updated code.

### 3. **No Force Pushes**  
Force pushes to the `main` branch are blocked. This ensures that the history of the branch remains consistent and that no changes are lost.

3. **Request a Review**: Ensure you request a review from at least one collaborator who will approve your changes.
4. **Address Feedback**: If feedback is provided, please update your pull request accordingly and ask for re-approval.

## Additional Notes

- **CI/CD Checks**: Before merging, all pull requests should pass the automated checks (tests, builds, etc.) to ensure the quality of the code.
